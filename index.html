            <h1> About Me </h1>
            I am a Maths and Physics graduate, whose main hobby is computing. My interests are
            broad, but on my GitHub you will mainly find software development tools and libraries.
            Privately however, I am also interested in graphics, games, and GPGPU computing.

            <h1> Projects </h1>
            My GitHub currently hosts three public projects. <br><br>

            <a class="project-link" href="https://deltaboybz.github.io/tabitha-sdk">The Tabitha SDK </a><br>
            <p>
            Tabitha is a new programming language, whose design and first compiler have been developed over the past few months. 
            Tabitha's flagship feature is its <em>context</em> model of global data. 
            This is a semi-safe way to share program data between many functions, and indeed many <em>slabs</em> (i.e. source files). 
            It also has a rich type system, arising from the action of type functors. 
            Tabitha works well on Linux systems. It has working version on Windows, though this is less-thoroughly tested. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The version the SDK linked here is a proof-of-concept. A new version, with many changes,
            is being developed privately. It is planned to be released sometime in 2024.
            </p>

            <a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/DeltaBoyBZ/eacy"> EAC-y </a>
            EAC-y is a toolkit to aid in <em> edit and continue </em> for C/C++ on Unix-like
            systems. It does this via an abstracted dynamic loading system controlled by macros. The
            toolkit does not work very well with virtual methods.

            <a class="project-link" href="https://deltaboybz.github.io/dop-c">DOP-C</a>
            <p>
            DOP-C is a very new project.
            It is a header-only library for creating and manipulating column-based data tables. 
            Tables are given a class <code>dopc::Table</code>, and so are their fields (columns). 
            The <code>dopc::Field</code> class has as single template argument for the type of field it is. 
            The precise mechanics of a library such as this were not immediately obvious to me,
            hence my previous attempt at something similar, Tabular-C++. 
            </p>

            <a class="project-link" href="https://deltaboybz.github.io/tabular-cpp"> Tabular-C++</a>
            <p>
            Tabular-C++ is a header library, along with a Python-based toolset for generating class definitions corresponding to data tables in C++. 
            Tabular-C++ was an attempt at what DOP-C is currently trying to achieve. 
            Though functional, Tabular-C++ suffers from a somewhat clunky workflow.
            The project is not entirely abandoned, but it is expected that development of DOP-C will soon dominate.
