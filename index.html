            <h1> About Me </h1>
            I am a Maths and Physics graduate, who considers computing his main hobby. 
            Privately, I am interested in graphics programming and general purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing.
            My public work however focuses on wider issues in software design. 
            I am currently developing a programming language called <a href="https://deltaboybz.github.io/tabitha-sdk"><strong>Tabitha</strong></a>, the first compiler being released recently.  
            I have developed two tools to facilitate data-oriented design in C++. 
            The first is <a href="https://deltaboybz.github.io/dop-c"><strong>DOP-C</strong></a>,
            a header-only library for creating an manipulating column-based data-tables. 
            The second is <a href="https://deltaboybz.github.io/tabular-cpp"><strong>Tabular-C++</strong></a>, an older project which inspired DOP-C. 
            It may still be worth checking out though.

            <h1> Projects </h1>
            My GitHub currently hosts three public projects. 

            <a class="project-link" href="https://deltaboybz.github.io/tabitha-sdk"><h2> The Tabitha SDK </h2></a>
            <p>
            Tabitha is a new programming language, whose design and first compiler have beend developed over the past few months. 
            Tabitha's flagship feature is its <em>context</em> model of global data. 
            This is a semi-safe way to share program data between many functions, and indeed many <em>slabs</em> (i.e. source files). 
            It also has a rich type system, arising from the action of type functors. 
            Tabitha works well on Linux systems. It has working version on Windows, though this is less-thoroughly tested. 
            </p>

            <a class="project-link" href="https://deltaboybz.github.io/dop-c"><h2>DOP-C </h2></a>
            <p>
            DOP-C is a very new project.
            It is a header-only library for creating and manipulating column-based data tables. 
            Tables are given a class <code>dopc::Table</code>, and so are their fields (columns). 
            The <code>dopc::Field</code> class has as single template argument for the type of field it is. 
            The precise mechanics of a library such as these were not immediately obvious to me,
            hence my previous attempt at something similar, Tabular-C++. 
            </p>

            <a class="project-link" href="https://deltaboybz.github.io/tabular-cpp"><h2> Tabular-C++ </h2></a>
            <p>
            Tabular-C++ is a header library, along with a Python-based toolset for generating class definitions corresponding to data tables in C++. 
            Tabular-C++ was an attempt at what DOP-C is currently trying to achieve. 
            Though function, Tabular-C++ suffers from a somewhat clunky workflow.
            The project is not entirely abandoned, but it is expected that development of DOP-C will soon dominate.
